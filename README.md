# ArduinoWordle
This arduino project was one of the most difficult projects that was completed in the Embedded systems class, requiring a substantial amount of time to fix the bugs that arose during the coding process

Essentially, it plays a game of wordle. There is a word that is stored in memory, and you need to guess what the word is, with a limited number of guesses. The game tells you if you guessed the letters correctly, and informs you whether you have the letter in the correct position as well.

<br>
Based off whether or not you got the word right, the program will either remove one guess or play the correct guess sequence!
